# AI Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for any AI agent working on this codebase. It is essential to follow these guidelines to ensure the quality and integrity of the code.

## Core Requirements

- **Complete Code Review:** Before committing any changes, you **MUST** obtain a complete code review from a human developer.
- **Passing Build with Tests:** You **MUST** ensure that the entire project builds successfully and that all tests pass before committing any changes. There are **NO** exceptions to this rule.
- **Keep Documentation Up-to-Date:** You **MUST** keep all documentation, including this file and the files in the `/docs` directory, up-to-date with any changes you make to the codebase.

## Documentation

The `/docs` directory contains detailed documentation about the project. These files are an extension of this `AGENTS.md` file and are equally important. You **MUST** read and understand the contents of the `/docs` directory before making any changes to the codebase.
